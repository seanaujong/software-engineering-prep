# NeoVim

In this directory, I document my journey of going from VSCode to NeoVim.

Everything in this directory will be created and modified by `nvim`.

I start my nvim journey by typing `nvim` in the terminal. This opens up a welcome screen that tells me to type `:help nvim`. Another screen pops up that tells me to type `:Tutor` for the 30-minute beginners tutorial. Now it's time for me to start learning some controls.

## How to exit vim

- `:q` lets you quit if you didn't change anything
- `:wq` lets you save and quit
- `:q!` lets you force quit without saving

## How to move 

- `hjkl` let you move left, down, up, right
- `w` and `b` let you move by word

## Switching between modes

You start off in Normal mode, which just lets you move around. You can press:

- `i` for Insert mode (editing)
- `v` for Visual mode (selecting)

Whenever you want to go back to Normal mode, press `Esc`.
