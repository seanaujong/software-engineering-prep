# Optional Curriculum

These interesting resources serve to further round out your education.

## ü§î More Math

My math curriculum in university included [calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21BCE50ABFF029F1), discrete math, probability, statistics, and linear algebra. You should also understand [üçÄhigh school algebra and trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/). This section features courses from HarvardX and MIT OCW. You can also check out [Zach Star's list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbwH63ezHw) for similar resources.

### From Probability and Statistics to Data Science

Data science requires background knowledge on probability and statistics.
