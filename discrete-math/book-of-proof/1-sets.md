# Sets

> All of mathematics can be described with sets.

A `set` is a collection of things called `elements`.

Example: the collection of all integers, ${...,-1,0,1,...}$

- the dots (`...`) indicate a pattern of numbers that continue forever in both positive and negative directions
- A set is `infinite` if it has infinitely many elements, otherwise it is `finite`

Two sets are `equal` if they contain the exact same elements, regardless of order

- ${1,2,3,4} = {4,3,2,1}$
- ${...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...} = {0,-1,1,-2,2,...}$
