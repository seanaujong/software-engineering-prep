To understand mathematics, we must understand what makes up a proof. A proof is a correct mathematical argument.

Once we prove a mathematical statement to be true, we call it a theorem.

Example of a mathematical statement: "For every positive integer `n`, the sum of the positive integers not exceeding `n` is `n(n+1)/2`."

Proofs are used to verify that computer programs produce the correct output for all possible input values, to show that algorithms always produce the correct result, to establish the security of a system, and to create artificial intelligence.

In this chapter, we will:

- explain what makes up a proof and introduce tools to construct these arguments.
- develop an arsenal of different proof methods to prove different types of results
- introduce several strategies for constructing proofs
- introduce the notion of a conjecture and explain the process of mathematics by studying conjectures
