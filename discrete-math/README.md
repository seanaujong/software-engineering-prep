What is discrete mathematics? Discrete mathematics studies objects consisting of distinct or unconnected elements. The kinds of problems solved using discrete math include:

- How many ways are there to choose a valid password on a computer system?
- What is the probability of winning a lottery?
- Is there a link between two computers in a network?
- How can I identify spam e-mail messages?
- How can I encrypt a message so that no unintended recipient can read it?
- What is the shortest path between two cities using a transportation system?
- How can a list of integers be sorted so that the integers are in increasing order?
- How many steps are required to do such a sorting?
- How can it be proved that a sorting algorithm correctly sorts a list?
- How can a circuit that adds two integers be designed?
- How many valid Internet addresses are there?

Discrete math is used whenever objects are counted, when relationships between finite or countable sets are studied, and when processes involving a finite number of steps are analyzed. Information stored by computing machines is discrete. Discrete math provides the mathematical foundations for many computer science courses, especially through the ability to read and write mathematical proofs.
