# Software Engineering Curriculum

This repo covers introductory computer science topics, and lays out a curriculum that resembles my [college degree][1]. You can also read my blog on [what I used to learn software engineering][2].

> Disclaimer: The content I post is NOT a replacement for a college degree. I strongly encourage pursuing a four-year computer science degree if you want to have a career in software engineering.

I denote the difficulty of each section with the following:

- üçÄ - Easy
- ü§î - Challenging
- ü§¨ - Hard

Even if the topic is difficult, I try to suggest the easiest content possible and provide üçÄhelpful resources.

## ü§î Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

CS50's Introduction to Computer Science is the foundation for all of your software engineering skills.

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science][3]

Here's what I want you to do while taking this course:

1. Watch every lecture, section, and short. Don't forget the lecture notes.
2. Do every practice problem, lab, and problem set question.
3. Watch [üçÄDorsCodingSchool][4]'s solutions to understand the problem-solving thought process.
4. USE THE [DEBUGGER][5]!
5. Read the [manual][6] and the [docs][7].
6. Learn how all the third-party software used in CS50 works. Can you explain what [Docker][8] is?

#### If CS50 is too difficult at first, then these two courses may help:

- [üçÄUnderstanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)
    - If you don't consider yourself a "computer person"
- [Introduction to Programming with Python](cs50.harvard.edu/python)
    - [üçÄDorsCodingSchool Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo_wesNOyQTNkV3DzBMz5HNfUDrVTEeh9)

## üçÄ Cloud

Now that you have some programming experience under the belt, let‚Äôs talk about the cloud. It seems like every company these days wants to ‚Äúmove to the cloud.‚Äù But what does that mean? Read this book to find out what the cloud is and why it‚Äôs so important.

## ü§î More CS50

This section features more content from the CS50 series that builds upon your foundational knowledge.

## ü§î Coding Interviews

Next, get used to LeetCode and coding interviews with the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) list. When you get stuck, it's time to formally learn the math behind algorithms.

- [üçÄAlgorithms from Khan Academy to MIT](https://medium.com/@seanaujong/an-introduction-to-algorithms-d3d5edab5b6a)

## ü§¨ Algorithms, Discrete Math, and Proofs

At this point, you might've started to realize that there's more to computer science than just programming and binary search. Take some time to watch the videos in this [üçÄplaylist by Zach Star](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi5WqFHu_OJMouMI0TC6uH4AjqJqKdA0x) on computer science and math. The resources in this section are meant to introduce you to theoretical mathematics as üçÄgently as possible.

### Proofs

Understanding algorithms often involves understanding their proofs. Learning discrete math helps you concoct and verify correct algorithms.

- [How to Prove It](https://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf)
- [Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)
  - [Notes](discrete-math/book-of-proof/README.md)

### Discrete Math

Now that we know a thing or two about proofs, discrete math should feel a lot more approachable:

- [üçÄWhy Discrete Math?](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/math-computer-science-discrete-math)
- [üçÄDiscrete Math with TrevTutor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDGPdw7e6Ag1EIznZ-m-qXu4XX3A0cIz)
  - [üçÄDiscrete Math 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDGPdw7e6Aj0amDsYInT_8p6xTSTGEi2)
- [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/)
  - [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60UlabZBeeqOuoLuj_KNphQ)

### Algorithms

And now that we have a feel for discrete math, these resources on algorithms won't confuse us whenever they mention proof by mathematical induction:

- [Algorithms Illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/)

# Optional Curriculum

You may have noticed that this document leaves out math subjects like probability, statistics, and linear algebra, as well as lower-level topics like computer architecture, operating systems, and compilers. [This optional document](./OPTIONAL.md) covers the rest of the curriculum.
