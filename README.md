# Software Engineering Curriculum

This repo covers introductory computer science topics, and lays out a curriculum that resembles my [college degree][1]. You can also read my blog on [what I used to learn software engineering][2].

I denote the difficulty of each section with the following:

- üçÄ - Easy
- ü§î - Challenging
- ü§¨ - Hard

Even if the topic is difficult, I try to suggest the easiest content possible and provide üçÄhelp.

## ü§î Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

CS50's Introduction to Computer Science is the foundation for all of your software engineering skills.

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science][3]

Here's what I want you to do while taking this course:

1. Watch every lecture, section, and short. Don't forget the lecture notes.
2. Do every practice problem, lab, and problem set question.
3. Watch [üçÄDorsCodingSchool][4]'s solutions to understand the problem-solving thought process.
4. USE THE [DEBUGGER][5]!
5. Read the [manual][6] and the [docs][7].
6. Learn how all the third-party software used in CS50 works. Can you explain what [Docker][8] is?

#### If CS50 is too difficult at first, then these two courses may help:

- [üçÄUnderstanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)
    - If you don't consider yourself a "computer person"
- [Introduction to Programming with Python](cs50.harvard.edu/python)
    - [üçÄDorsCodingSchool Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo_wesNOyQTNkV3DzBMz5HNfUDrVTEeh9)

## üçÄ Cloud

Now that you have some programming experience under the belt, let‚Äôs talk about the cloud. It seems like every company these days wants to ‚Äúmove to the cloud.‚Äù But what does that mean? Read this book to find out what the cloud is and why it‚Äôs so important.

- [üçÄExplain the Cloud Like I'm 10](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765C4SNR)

## ü§î Practical Skills

It's important to be familiar with web programming and artificial intelligence. Make a side project with these skills.

- [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)
- [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)
    - [üçÄ[Short] What is the difference between AI and Data Science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNrw64dmfpk)
- [More CS50 Courses](https://www.edx.org/cs50)

## ü§î Coding Interviews

Next, get used to LeetCode and coding interviews with the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) list. When you get stuck, move on to the algorithms section.

- [Coding Interviews with Python and NeetCode](https://medium.com/@seanaujong/getting-started-with-technical-interviews-for-software-engineering-as-a-college-freshman-64dbecc0b15c)

## ü§¨ Algorithms

This section will help you go from [üçÄTwo Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) to [Alien Dictionary](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/892/).

- [üçÄAlgorithms from Khan Academy to MIT](https://medium.com/@seanaujong/an-introduction-to-algorithms-d3d5edab5b6a)
- [Algorithms Illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/)

## ü§î Math

My math curriculum in university included [calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21BCE50ABFF029F1), discrete math, probability, statistics, and linear algebra. The prerequisite is [üçÄhigh school algebra and trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/). These skills are used in the data science and machine learning fields. This section features courses from HarvardX and MIT OCW.
