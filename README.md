# Software Engineering Curriculum

This repo covers introductory computer science topics, and lays out a curriculum that resembles my [college degree](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/documents/4-Year%20Plan_1.pdf). You can also read my blog on [what I used to learn software engineering][1].
