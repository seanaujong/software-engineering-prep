# Software Engineering Curriculum

This repo covers introductory computer science topics, and lays out a curriculum that resembles my [college degree][1]. You can also read my blog on [what I used to learn software engineering][2].

I denote the difficulty of each section with the following:

- 😎 Easy
- 🤔 Challenging
- 🤬 Hard

Even if the topic is hard 🤬, I try to suggest the easiest content possible and provide supplementary resources.

## 🤔 Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

> Challenging

CS50's Introduction to Computer Science is the foundation for all of your software engineering skills. Here's what I want you to do:

0. Take [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science][3] course
1. Watch every lecture, section, and short. Don't forget the lecture notes.
2. Do every practice problem, lab, and problem set question.
3. Watch [DorsCodingSchool][4]'s solutions to understand the problem-solving thought process.
4. USE THE [DEBUGGER][5]!
5. Read the [manual][6] and the [docs][7].
6. Learn how all the third-party software used in CS50 works. Can you explain what [Docker][8] is?

#### If CS50 is too difficult at first, then these two courses may help:

- [Understanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)
    - If you don't consider yourself a "computer person"
- [Introduction to Programming with Python](cs50.harvard.edu/python)
    - [DorsCodingSchool Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo_wesNOyQTNkV3DzBMz5HNfUDrVTEeh9)

## 😎 Cloud

> Easy

Now that you have some programming experience under the belt, let’s talk about the cloud. It seems like every company these days wants to “move to the cloud.” But what does that mean? Read this book to find out what the cloud is and why it’s so important.

- [Explain the Cloud Like I'm 10](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765C4SNR)

## 🤔 Practical Skills

> Challenging

It's important to be familiar with web programming and artificial intelligence. Make a side project with these skills.

- [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)
- [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)
    - [[Short] What is the difference between AI and Data Science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNrw64dmfpk)
- [More CS50 Courses](https://www.edx.org/cs50)

## 🤔 Coding Interviews

> Challenging

Next, get used to LeetCode and coding interviews with the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) list. Did you get stuck? It's time to learn more about algorithms.

- [Coding Interviews with Python and NeetCode](https://medium.com/@seanaujong/getting-started-with-technical-interviews-for-software-engineering-as-a-college-freshman-64dbecc0b15c)
- [Khan Academy to MIT](https://medium.com/@seanaujong/an-introduction-to-algorithms-d3d5edab5b6a)

## 🤬 Algorithms and Math

My math curriculum in university included [calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21BCE50ABFF029F1), discrete math, probability, statistics, and linear algebra. The prerequisite is [high school algebra and trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/). These skills are used in the data science and machine learning fields.

### From Probability and Statistics to Data Science

## 🤬 Hardware to Software

Unless you decide to work on lower-level systems, you don't need to completely master the content in here. However, operating systems are core to any computer science curriculum.
