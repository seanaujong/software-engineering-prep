# Software Engineering Curriculum

This repo covers introductory computer science topics, and lays out a curriculum that resembles my [college degree][1]. You can also read my blog on [what I used to learn software engineering][2].

I denote the difficulty of each section with the following:

- üçÄ - Easy
- ü§î - Challenging
- ü§¨ - Hard

Even if the topic is difficult, I try to suggest the easiest content possible and provide üçÄhelpful resources.

## ü§î Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

CS50's Introduction to Computer Science is the foundation for all of your software engineering skills.

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science][3]

Here's what I want you to do while taking this course:

1. Watch every lecture, section, and short. Don't forget the lecture notes.
2. Do every practice problem, lab, and problem set question.
3. Watch [üçÄDorsCodingSchool][4]'s solutions to understand the problem-solving thought process.
4. USE THE [DEBUGGER][5]!
5. Read the [manual][6] and the [docs][7].
6. Learn how all the third-party software used in CS50 works. Can you explain what [Docker][8] is?

#### If CS50 is too difficult at first, then these two courses may help:

- [üçÄUnderstanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)
    - If you don't consider yourself a "computer person"
- [Introduction to Programming with Python](cs50.harvard.edu/python)
    - [üçÄDorsCodingSchool Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo_wesNOyQTNkV3DzBMz5HNfUDrVTEeh9)

## üçÄ Cloud

Now that you have some programming experience under the belt, let‚Äôs talk about the cloud. It seems like every company these days wants to ‚Äúmove to the cloud.‚Äù But what does that mean? Read this book to find out what the cloud is and why it‚Äôs so important.

## ü§î Practical Skills

It's important to be familiar with web programming and artificial intelligence. Make a side project with these skills.

## ü§î Coding Interviews

Next, get used to LeetCode and coding interviews with the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) list. When you get stuck, it's time to formally learn discrete math and algorithms.

## ü§¨ Discrete Math and Algorithms

This section will help you go from [üçÄTwo Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) to [Alien Dictionary](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/892/). Understanding algorithms often involves understanding their proofs. Learning discrete math helps you concoct and verify correct algorithms.

### Discrete Math

Why proofs? Here's an excerpt from the Book of Proof:

> Until this point in your education, mathematics has probably been
presented as a primarily computational discipline. You have learned to
solve equations, compute derivatives and integrals, multiply matrices and
find determinants; and you have seen how these things can answer practical
questions about the real world. In this setting your primary goal in using
mathematics has been to compute answers.

> But there is another side of mathematics that is more theoretical than
computational. Here the primary goal is to understand mathematical
structures, to prove mathematical statements, and even to invent or discover
new mathematical theorems and theories. The mathematical techniques
and procedures that you have learned and used up until now are founded
on this theoretical side of mathematics. For example, in computing the area
under a curve, you use the fundamental theorem of calculus. It is because
this theorem is true that your answer is correct. However, in learning
calculus you were probably far more concerned with how that theorem could
be applied than in understanding why it is true. But how do we know it is
true? How can we convince ourselves or others of its validity? Questions of
this nature belong to the theoretical realm of mathematics.

> You will learn and apply the methods of thought that mathematicians use to verify theorems,
explore mathematical truth and create new mathematical theories. This
will prepare you for advanced mathematics courses, for you will be better
able to understand proofs, write your own proofs and think critically and
inquisitively about mathematics.

- [Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)
  - [Notes](discrete-math/book-of-proof/README.md)

Now that we know a thing or two about proofs, discrete math should feel a lot more approachable:

### Algorithms

And now that we have a feel for discrete math, these resources on algorithms won't confuse us whenever they mention proof by mathematical induction:

## ü§î Math

My math curriculum in university included [calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21BCE50ABFF029F1), discrete math, probability, statistics, and linear algebra. You should also understand [üçÄhigh school algebra and trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/). This section features courses from HarvardX and MIT OCW.

### From Probability and Statistics to Data Science

Data science requires background knowledge on probability and statistics.

### Linear Algebra

The concepts of linear algebra are crucial for understanding the theory behind machine learning, especially for deep learning.

## ü§¨ Hardware to Software

Unless you decide to work on lower-level systems, you don't need to completely master the content in here. However, operating systems are core to any computer science curriculum.
